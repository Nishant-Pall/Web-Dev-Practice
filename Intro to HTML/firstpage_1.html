	<p>Lorem Ipsum is <b>simply dummy text </b>of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's <strong>standard dummy text</strong> ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has <i>survived not only five centuries</i>, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. </p>
	<p> It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with <em>desktop publishing software</em> like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
